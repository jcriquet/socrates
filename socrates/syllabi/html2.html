<h4>Student Learning Outcomes</h4>
	<p>Students will be able to:<br>
	1.  Create a website that incorporates advanced coding techniques.<br>
	2.  Develop webpages that conform to HTML 5 standard.<br>
	3.  Summarize the following website development concepts: shorthand properties, the cascade, descendant selectors, webpage flow, form processing using an existing CGI script, post vs. get, and environmental variables.</p>
<h4>Required Materials</h4>
